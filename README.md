# Text-Minesweeper
This is a minesweeper game I made in high school using python's curses library. Below are the instructions to download and play
Download
------------
On OSX or Linux, open a terminal and type the following:
~~~sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jherndon8/Text-Minesweeper/master/textmine.py
~~~
You should only need to do this once, and then you should be able to skip to the Run step whenever you open the terminal
Run
------------
To begin, in the same terminal type the following:
~~~sh
$ python textmine.py
~~~
Instructions
------------
This game is keyboard based. Arrow keys are used for navigating the field and the menu. Press 'f' to mark a cell as a flag and 'd' to dig at a specific point. Additionally, if you press 'd' on a number that has already been dug, it will dig on all the non-marked spots surrounding it. To end the game or quit the program, press 'q'.
####Enjoy!
