This is a minesweeper game I made in high school using python's curses library. Below are the instructions to download and play
Download

On OSX or Linux, open a terminal and type the following:
~~~sh
$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jherndon8/Text-Minesweeper/master/textmine.py

You should only need to do this once, and then you should be able to skip to the Run step whenever you open the terminal
Run

To begin, in the same terminal type the following:

####Enjoy!
